            <h1>Dine Out Tonite</h1>
            <p>
              Join us for a fancy outdoor dinner for two! Our region is known
              for good seafood, and crab cakes are a traditional favorite.
              <br />I learned to make them from a chef in a restaurant where
              they were a best-seller. <br />The crabmeat's sweet and mild
              flavor is sparked by the blend of other ingredients.

            <p>
              Established in 1812 and named after the town’s best fish
              "cacciatore nel Mundo", Tony Carlucci, our lobster-home is a
              family friendly venue delighting customers again and again with
              its home style breakfast and lunch (dinner is served Friday and
              Saturday nights). Seafood lovers know to head to Carluccio's® Fish
              House for some of the freshest seafood dishes available. Next door
              to Bell Buoy, their seafood specialty store, this family-owned and
              operated café is a casual joint where guests can savor some of the
              tastiest clam chowder around. The menu also features great options
              such as fish and chips made with halibut, wild salmon, or cod,
              seaside razor clams either grilled or deep fried, and crab cakes.
              Seafood melts are also available in shrimp or crab varieties along
              with cocktails and shooters.
              <br>
              <br>
              <p>Today, we still peel our Gulf shrimp, shuck our Galveston bay oysters and fillet our fresh fish, by hand, the same way TC did more than 100 years ago. Because the Carlucci’s family has always remained passionate about food with our focus on taste. Our unique sauces, seasonings, salad dressings and delicious desserts are all house-made from time-tested family recipes. And over the decades, we blended in traditional southern deep-frying, Southwest open-flame grilling and rich Creole flavors. By infusing these wonderful surrounding cultures, Carluccio's® creates a menu and an experience unlike any other perched on the seawall.</p>
